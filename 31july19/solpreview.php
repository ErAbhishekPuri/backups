<p><strong>BACKGROUND &ndash; user generated with guidance notes</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Four days after commencing employment with the First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent, the Claimant was appointed as acting Assistant Branch Manager by Claire O'Donovan (Business Development Director).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>The Claimant was the first member of staff employed by the First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent at the Finchley Branch and had sole responsibility for running the office including bidding for new clients, risk assessments, carer recruitment and supervision as well as the out of hours mobile phone.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>On 1<sup>st</sup> July 2017 the Claimant was appointed to the substantive post of Assistant Branch Manager and her salary was increased to &pound;25,000 to reflect her new position. Claire O&rsquo;Donovan gave the Claimant a letter of appointment with a target of 1000 hours of service provision. If the Claimant reached this target she would be registered as a branch manager with the Care Quality Commission. The letter states <em>inter alia</em>;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I explained to you that we are promoting you in recognition of the job you have been doing since you commenced your employment with us and the fact that you have managed the office almost singlehandedly in a very professional and efficient way. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>You will take full responsibility for the day to day functioning of the London Finchley Operation with my support as and when necessary. Your aim will be to build this branch to approximately 1000 hours of service provision and if you are able to achieve this then we will consider offering you the position of Branch Manager and register you with the Care Quality Commission. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>I have every belief that you will be able to achieve this, and I look forward to working closely with you over the coming months.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>We spoke about your strengths and weaknesses and I pointed out that you need to be conscious of your accent when verbally communicating and to speak more slowly, clearly and audibly so that you can ensure effective communication at all times. &nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for all your hard work to date and I look forward to building the London operation alongside you.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>In addition, Claire O&rsquo;Donovan advised the Claimant to obtain the Management and Leadership Level 5 Certificate in order to be considered for the Branch Manager position.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Although Claire O&rsquo;Donovan was the registered manager with the Care Quality Commission at the time, she was not based at the Finchley Office, and would rarely attend the office.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>The Claimant was promised that more staff would be recruited. This did not occur, and the Claimant alone covered the roles of Manager, Care Coordinator, Recruitment Officer, and Care Field Supervisor until 1<sup>st</sup> March 2018. Including the requirement for her to be on-call, the Claimant worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for a year.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>During January 2018 Claire O&rsquo;Donovan came to the Finchley Office and informed the Claimant that a Healthcare Manager had been appointed by name of Nishant Dalal who would commence on 1<sup>st</sup> March 2018. In May 2018, Margaret Robinson was appointed as Recruitment Officer. <br /> </li>
<li>Claire O&rsquo;Donovan informed the Claimant that the Healthcare Manager would be responsible for supplying carers to care homes and hospitals, whilst the Claimant would retain her role as Assistant Branch Manager with responsibility for domiciliary healthcare. She also stated that Nishant Dalal would bring most of the carers from his previous company to the Finchley Branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>A few weeks after Nishant Dalal commenced work at the Finchley Branch, he informed the Claimant that he had an appointment with the Care Quality Commission for his registration interview to become a Branch Manager.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Terry Jansen (Training Officer) had applied for a grant to enable the Claimant to undergo the Management and Leadership Level 5 Certificate. The grant was disbursed at the end of May 2018. The Claimant was surprised to discover that Nishant Dalal did not have the qualification and would be attending the same course with her. Up until that point, the Claimant thought that Nishant Dalal had been appointed Branch Manager because he already had the Management and Leadership Level 5 Certificate qualification.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>On 1<sup>st</sup> August 2018 the Claimant was informed that Sylvia Rob who had previously been employed as Assistant Branch Manager would be returning as the new Operations Manager of the Finchley Branch.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>During conversation with Nishant Dalal, the Claimant asked him what the salary of the Operations Manager was. Nishant Dalal informed the Claimant that Sylvia Rob would earn more than he did. He was on an annual salary of &pound;43,000 and Sylvia Rob was on around &pound;47, 000.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>The Claimant was on a salary of &pound;25,000 and upset by the revelations, she requested a meeting with Claire O&rsquo;Donovan and raised a grievance with her during that meeting on 1<sup>st</sup> August 2018.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>During the meeting, the Claimant asked Claire O&rsquo;Donovan if she was unhappy with her performance in any way. Claire O&rsquo;Donovan responded that she was very proud of the Claimant for having managed the branch singlehanded for a year with a salary that did not reflect her workload, and never complaining.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>The Claimants grievance conveyed to Claire O&rsquo;Donovan was as follows;</li>
<li>She was unhappy with the changes imposed by the Respondent because they were discriminatory against her on grounds of race and sex.</li>
<li>That Nishant Dalal was paid &pound;18,000 more than the Claimant and this was against the statutory provisions on work of equal value and amounted to sex and race discrimination.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>That Nishant Dalal had been made Branch Manager, and the Claimant had never been told that there was a vacancy and not even given an opportunity to apply for it. This was sex and race discrimination.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>That Sylvia Rob was being appointed as the Operations Manager on a salary of &pound;47,000. The Claimant had done her job for a year and had never been told that there was a vacancy and not even given an opportunity to apply for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>Claire O&rsquo;Donovan told the Claimant that she was sorry that she felt that way. She said that she had informed Nishant Dalal before starting the Finchley Branch that when the branch got to a&nbsp;certain level of development, he could come in. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>The Claimant informed Claire O&rsquo;Donovan, that the decision was unfair because Nishant Dalal had no experience of managing a branch which the Claimant had done for a year. He was also doing the same Management and Leadership Level 5 Certificate as she was and yet was paid &pound;18,000 more than the Claimant. The Claimant was also aggrieved that Sylvia Rob had been away for a year and was being brought back at a higher position and wage whilst the Claimant remained on low salary.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Claire O&rsquo;Donovan apologised for not informing the Claimant about the appointment of Nishant Dalal. The meeting ended with a commitment to discuss the outcome of her grievance on the Claimants return from her 1-month annual leave in Africa.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>The Claimant returned to work from annual leave on 11<sup>th</sup> September 2018. On that same day, Claire O&rsquo;Donovan asked the Claimant to a meeting in the training room and asked her if she had thought about their meeting on 1<sup>st</sup> August 2018.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>The Claimant responded that she had just returned from leave and would prefer to discuss the issues later since she had a lot of catching up to do. Claire O&rsquo;Donovan then informed the Claimant that she had thought about the issues raised by the Claimant in her grievance and had decided to make the Claimant redundant.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>Claire O&rsquo;Donovan then stated that the redundancy was necessary because of the result of the Care Quality Commission Inspection, and that if the result was not good, the Respondent would have no more clients from Haringey Council.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>The Claimant asked her what the outcome of the Care Quality Commission Inspection was and was told that the result had not yet been received. The Claimant then asked why she was being made redundant if the Inspection outcomes were unknown.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Claire O&rsquo;Donovan stated that the possible outcome of the Care Quality Commission Inspection was not the only reason, but that the company was in financial difficulties. The Claimant informed her that the company was not in financial difficulties because she had been given a handover that morning which showed that the Finchley Branch was at 990 hours of service provision and had acquired two 24-hour service provision clients.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Claire O&rsquo;Donovan stated that the company was being restructured and she was sorry but there was no longer a job for her. She gave the Claimant the option of staying at work or remaining at home on 1 month&rsquo;s garden leave. The Claimant opted to stay at home and left.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Protected Disclosure (this title will be auto generated depending on what the user selects in the dropdown menu at paragraph 7.)</u></strong></p>
<ol start="32">
<li>On 1<sup>st</sup> August 2018, the Claimant disclosed the following information to Claire O&rsquo;Donovan in her grievance;
<ul>
<li>That she was unhappy with the changes imposed by the Respondent because they were discriminatory against her on grounds of race and sex.</li>
<li>That Nishant Dalal was paid &pound;18,000 more than the Claimant and this was against the statutory provisions on work of equal value and amounted to sex and race discrimination.</li>
<li>That Nishant Dalal had been made Branch Manager, and the Claimant had never been told that there was a vacancy and not even given an opportunity to apply for it. This was sex and race discrimination.</li>
<li>That Sylvia Rob was being appointed as the Operations Manager on a salary of &pound;47,000. The Claimant had done her job for a year and had never been told that there was a vacancy and not even given an opportunity to apply for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>This was a qualifying disclosure because it contained information tending to show that the First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent was failing or was likely to fail to comply with a legal obligation to which it was subject, that obligation being;</li>
<li>The employment contract with the Claimant.</li>
<li>The Equality Act 2010</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The service contract with Haringey Council and the Councils statutory obligations under the Public Sector Equality Duty (s.149 Equality Act 2010).</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>The Claimant had a reasonable belief that disclosure was in the public interest because the provision of regulated care and support that the First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent provides to local authorities, the NHS and the general public is a public function.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>The disclosure was a protected disclosure as it was made to the First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent as the Claimants employer.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>The reason or the principal reason for the Claimants selection for redundancy and dismissal was that she made a protected disclosure to Claire O&rsquo;Donovan on 1<sup>st</sup> August 2018.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>Therefore, her dismissal was contrary to sections 105(6A) and 103A of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA 1996) and is automatically unfair.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Detriment prior to dismissal - (this title will be auto generated depending on what the user selects in the dropdown menu at paragraph 7.)</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="38">
<li>The Claimant suffered the following detrimental treatment because of her disclosure:
<ul>
<li>The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent failed to consult or warn the Claimant about the redundancy.</li>
<li>The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent applied unfair selection criteria in that the Claimant was the only employee selected for redundancy.</li>
<li>The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent failed to offer the Claimant alternative employment even though there was alternative employment.</li>
<li>The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent failed to allow the Claimant to exercise her right to be accompanied at the meeting where she was dismissed.</li>
<li>The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent gave the Claimant no right of appeal.</li>

<p><strong><u>Direct Sex Discrimination (this title will be auto generated depending on what the user selects in the dropdown menu at paragraph 7.)</u></strong></p>
<ol start="39">
<li>The Claimant was paid &pound;18,000 less than Nishant Dalal for doing the same work.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Direct Race Discrimination (this title will be auto generated depending on what the user selects in the dropdown menu at paragraph 7.)</u></strong></p>
<ol start="40">
<li>The Claimant avers that there was no genuine redundancy situation, in that the dismissal was not by reason of redundancy, but was instead by reason of race and thus constituted direct discrimination for the following reasons;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Claimant repeats her averments in paragraph 38 above.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Claimant raised a grievance with Claire O&rsquo;Donovan on 1<sup>st</sup> August 2018 that she was being discriminated against on grounds of race and sex. The response to her grievance was dismissal.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of the Claimants race, she was treated less favourably than Nishant Dalal and Margaret Robinson. The Claimant was the first employee in the Finchley Branch. The circumstances constituting the alleged redundancy applied equally to Nishant Dalal who was appointed on 1st March 2018 and Margaret Robinson who commenced in May 2018 however they were not selected for redundancy or dismissed by the Respondent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent was not in financial difficulties neither had work ceased or diminished because the Finchley Branch was at 990 hours of service provision and had acquired two 24-hour service provision clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>During the same month that the Claimant was dismissed for redundancy, Sylvia Rob was appointed in October 2018 and Marilia Araujo who had been working as a manager in Birmingham was transferred to the Finchley Branch in London. These roles were suitable alternative vacancies that were not offered to the Claimant.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent has branches in Haringey (London), Hereford, Birmingham, Northampton and Mansfield and yet did not consider the option of re-deploying the Claimant.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Claire O&rsquo;Donovan advised the Claimant that her accent was a problem, and that it was very difficult for people to understand her when she was talking over the phone, further that one of the Director found her difficult to understand because of her strong accent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Claimant was not warned or consulted, properly or at all, of the impending redundancy situation. The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent did not choose selection criteria which were fair and objective, neither was the Claimant consulted about the selection criteria or the weightings given to these.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Claimant was not offered a right of appeal and was not allowed to be accompanied to the meeting regarding her dismissal.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Claimant repeats her averments in paragraph 38 above.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<ol start="42">
<li>The application of the selection criteria, or lack thereof, the failure to offer alternative employment, and all other aspects of the redundancy process employed by the First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent was influenced by the Claimants protected characteristic of race and thereby amounted to indirect discrimination.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent applied the following provisions, criteria and practices (PCPs) to the Claimant in selecting her for redundancy:&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Failing to offer alternative employment.</li>
<li>Requiring the Claimant to moderate her accent.</li>
<li>Selection criteria based on unidentified possible future financial issues in the company.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Selection criteria based on the probability of the Care Quality Commission Report not being positive.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="44">
<li>The First Respondent and/or the Second Respondent applied the PCPs identified at paragraph 39, above. The said PCPs did put or would put persons sharing the Claimant&rsquo;s race at a particular disadvantage when compared with persons who are not black. The Claimant herself was placed at that disadvantage. The PCPs were not a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<ol start="48">
<li>The Claimant was able to obtain a position relatively quickly as Deputy Manager with Heritage Healthcare. Heritage Healthcare requested a job reference from the Respondent. &nbsp;Claire O&rsquo;Donovan gave the Claimant an unfavourable reference because she applied for Early Conciliation with ACAS.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="49">
<li>In response to the question whether the Respondent would re-employ the Claimant, the reference states;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em> We would have offered her employment had there been a suitable vacancy based on her work history with us as she had shown herself to be a dedicated employee. However, she has since being made redundant become uncooperative and argumentative and this is not a characteristic we observed when she was employed. Whilst we understand her feeling aggrieved by being made redundant, we were disappointed nevertheless by her attitude and this is the reason for our negative response to this question. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<ol start="50">
<li>The reference further states;
<ul>
<li><em>Danielle worked in a dutiful and co-operative way when she was Line Managed by a Director. When a new branch manager was appointed, she felt that she had been unfairly superseded and became resentful and un-cooperative with the new Manager and started questioning the Director. It became noticeable that her work ethos became very laid back at this stage as she was not receptive to the changes being made. Prior to this Danielle was always a happy and hardworking employee so it was very disappointing to see her respond to the changes we made so negatively.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Danielle&rsquo;s post was made redundant and unfortunately, she left the company very aggrieved as she felt that the redundancy was unfair. She approached ACAS with a view to taking the Company to a Tribunal and raised a formal grievance claiming she had been discriminated against on grounds of race and sex. The Company acted legitimately in line with Statutory obligations and her grievance was not upheld. She has since made a request under GDPR Regs for all electronic correspondence relating to her redundancy to be sent to her. We are unsure if she intends to pursue a tribunal claim which we will vigorously and confidently defend should she choose to pursue this course of action. </em></li>
